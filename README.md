# [X] The Static Web: HTML + CSS Milestone Challenge

### Status

- [X] Complete but needs css styling and content.

### Create a page for your personal branding that will showcase your work and be used as part of your graduation self-marketing.
## Setup

All of your work should be on a branch, NOT on master. Work in a `challenge` branch.

If you would like to have your work reviewed, push up the branch (`git push origin challenge`), submit a pull request on Github, and Slack the instruction team with a request for review (be sure to include a link to your repo). A member of the instruction team will take a look and give feedback. Your work does not need to be complete to receive feedback.

## Instructions

Create a page for your own personal branding that can be treated as the beginning of your portfolio. You should focus on HTML structure and syntax with basic layout using styles.
